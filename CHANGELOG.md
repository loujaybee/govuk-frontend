## 0.0.21-alpha (Breaking release)

Breaking changes:

- The link styles in the core layer no longer style `a` elements directly, but
  instead provide a `govuk-link` class which you will need to apply to links
  individually. (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
- The link component has been removed from Frontend as the link styles have
  been moved to the core
  (PR [#431](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/431))
- Rename `legal-text` argument accepted by `legal-text` component to `text` (PR [#431](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/432))
- Rename `legal-text` component to `warning-text` (PR [#431](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/432))

New features:

- The prose scope has been extended to style links, which means links within the
  scope do not need the `govuk-link` class applied.
  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
- The muted link variant from the link component is now available as a core
  class (`govuk-link--muted`).
  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))

Fixes:

- The error summary component allows users to pass HTML for an entry in the list
  again. (PR [#428](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/428))
- Error list entries in the error summary component no longer get wrapped in
  links when no `href` is provided.
  (PR [#428](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/428))
- Remove redundant 'resets' for link print styles
  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
- The back link, breadcrumbs, error summary, previous / next and skip link
  components have been updated to include explicit link styling, as they
  previously relied on the global link styles.
  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
- Adjust `warning-text` icon by 1px for New Transport

Internal:

  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
- Improve documentation around publishing (PR [#430](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/430))
