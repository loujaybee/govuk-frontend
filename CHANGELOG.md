Note: We're not following semantic versioning yet, we are going to talk about this soon.

## Unreleased

Internal:

- Fixes for the release process
(PR [#567](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/567))

## 0.0.24-alpha (Breaking release)

Breaking changes:

- Namespace existing mixins and functions ( PR [#557](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/557))
- The class `.govuk-section-break__visible` has been renamed to
  `.govuk-section-break--visible` as it is a modifier, not an element.
  (PR [#547](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/547))
- Simplify `src/` folder structure, remove tree and string manipulations from
gulp tasks (PR [#545](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/545))

New features:

- A new variable `$govuk-input-border-colour` has been introduced to define the
  border colour for inputs. The Input, Select and Textarea components have been
  updated to use it.
  (PR [#551](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/551))

Fixes:
- Removes media query display on body from compiled CSS
  (PR [#560](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/560))

- Fieldset legends now correctly use 'full black' text colour when printed
  (PR [#544](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/544))
- Radio and Checkbox components now explicitly use currentColor for their
  borders, rather than relying on inheriting it
  (PR [#551](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/551))

Internal:

- The 'prose scope' has been updated to extend only placeholder classes. The
  corresponding classes the prose scope extends have been updated to provide a
  placeholder class and separately create the concrete class. This allows us
  to be specific about which occurrences of the class are meant to be extended.
  (PR [#550](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/550))
- The sass-lint config has been updated to prevent the use of `@extend` with
  concrete classes.
  (PR [#550](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/550))
- Release process has been streamlined with fewer steps
  (PR [#553](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/553))

## 0.0.22-alpha (Breaking release)

  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
